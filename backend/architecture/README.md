# Backend architecture policy

`policy.json` is the source for package and runtime write ownership, package
roles, tenant-safe read projections, legacy-composition symbols, dependency
classes, import scopes, and target import rules. Generated lint configs and
diagrams must derive from this file and must not be committed.

## Commands

Run commands from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/backend-architecture.sh check
scripts/backend-architecture.sh check \
  --baseline architecture/legacy.jsonl
scripts/backend-architecture.sh check \
  --baseline architecture/legacy.jsonl \
  --base-ref "$BASE_SHA"
scripts/backend-architecture.sh audit-issues \
  --baseline architecture/legacy.jsonl \
  --api-url "$GITHUB_API_URL"
scripts/backend-architecture.sh explain \
  --scope production \
  --source github.com/moto-nrw/project-phoenix/services/mealplan \
  --target github.com/moto-nrw/project-phoenix/models/mealplan
```

`check` loads packages with `GOOS=linux`, `GOARCH=amd64`, and `CGO_ENABLED=0`.
It checks production imports, same-package test imports, and external-package
test imports as separate scopes. Every package explicitly declares all three
roles. Test roles describe the seam (`module-internal-test`,
`module-behavior-test`, `workflow-decision-test`,
`workflow-integration-test`, `adapter-test`, or `e2e-test`), so production
permissions cannot leak into test scopes. A finding uses this stable key:

```text
scope|rule|source|target
```

Production analysis also uses Go syntax and type information to enforce these
semantic boundaries:

- a table has one runtime write owner;
- foreign reads require an owner query or an exact `read_projections` grant
  whose `tenant_safe` flag is true;
- foreign reads and writes are detected in BUN table/model calls, joins, SQL
  fragments, and raw SQL; writes also include `MERGE` and `TRUNCATE`;
- unresolved or unclassified table expressions remain findings;
- direct BUN/SQL access is restricted to Postgres, migration, test-support,
  and named projection adapters;
- public/contract packages cannot expose ORM, repository, internal-model,
  `map[string]any`, generic CRUD, or BUN-tagged types;
- references to the exact symbols in `legacy_composition` are findings outside
  the defining package.

`data_objects` contains target-owned runtime data, not every historical table
ever created by a migration. Access to an obsolete table with no target owner
therefore remains a `tables.unclassified` finding until that access and table
are removed; do not invent an owner merely to make the check quiet.

The current backend still violates the target policy. `check --baseline` enables
the exact shrinking-ratchet mechanics, but this slice intentionally does not
commit or activate the production baseline. Until the CI cutover, CI runs
`legacy-check` to keep the existing go-arch-lint gate active.

## Exact legacy ratchet

The legacy baseline is canonical JSONL sorted by `scope|rule|source|target`.
Each record has exactly these fields in this order:

```json
{"scope":"production","rule":"imports.forbidden","source":"example/source","target":"example/target","issue":"https://github.com/moto-nrw/project-phoenix/issues/1234"}
```

The first four fields identify one exact violation. `issue` identifies its one
open migration ticket. Wildcards, package-family patterns, blank lines,
duplicates, unsorted records, non-canonical JSON, and issue reassignment are
errors. The normal command has no init, approve, update, or rebaseline mode.

Local mode requires exact equality between the current violations and the
candidate baseline. PR mode adds `--base-ref` with the event's full 40-character
base commit SHA and reads the baseline and policy directly from that Git object.
Candidate entries must be a subset of the base entries, unchanged entries must
keep their issue, and candidate policy, package classification, and ownership
changes may not weaken the checks enforced by the base policy.

`audit-issues` performs the network-dependent GitHub liveness check separately.
It requires an explicit `--api-url`; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional for authenticated requests.
It accepts `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authenticated requests. A GitHub or network error
fails only this audit and cannot change the deterministic `check` result.

## Changing the policy

1. Add or move the exact package classification and data-object owner.
2. Classify each new direct dependency. Do not use path wildcards.
3. Name every projection package, readable data object, and tenant-safety
   guarantee explicitly; projection grants never permit writes.
4. Add the narrowest owner, owner-kind, role, scope, and target selector that
   describes the intended seam.
5. Run `scripts/backend-architecture.sh check` and inspect every changed
   finding.
6. Run `cd backend && go test ./internal/architecture`.

The shared-kernel declaration is a closed list: `Date`, `WallClock`,
`TenantID`, and `CorrelationID`; kernel-owned packages must be contracts. The
loader rejects unknown JSON fields,
unsupported schema versions, invalid enum values, missing or conflicting table
owners, unsafe or overlapping projection grants, stale legacy symbols,
duplicate classifications, stale packages, unknown dependencies, and
logically overlapping rules. Change
`schema_version` only when the JSON shape changes. Change `policy_epoch` only
for a reviewed architecture decision; it does not approve or rebuild legacy
findings.
