package common

// Package common contains shared types and utilities used across multiple IoT API domains.
// This package is created as part of the IoT API refactoring (Phase 1: Preparation).
//
// Note: Types will be added here during subsequent refactoring phases as we identify
// genuine duplication across domains. For now, this serves as a placeholder to establish
// the package structure.

// Future shared types may include:
// - Common student/staff info structures
// - Shared response wrapper types
// - Common validation types
// - Shared enum constants
