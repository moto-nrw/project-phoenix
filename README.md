## 📖 About

Project Phoenix is a comprehensive room and student management system designed for educational institutions in compliance with European data protection regulations. It leverages RFID technology to track student attendance and location in real-time, providing administrators with powerful tools for monitoring room occupancy, managing activities, and generating detailed analytics.

### Why Project Phoenix?

- **Privacy-First Design** — Built from the ground up with GDPR compliance, featuring configurable data retention, audit logging, and right-to-erasure support
- **Real-Time Visibility** — Know instantly where students are, which rooms are occupied, and how spaces are being utilized
- **Modern Stack** — Go backend with Next.js 16 frontend, designed for performance and developer experience
- **Self-Hosted** — Your data stays on your infrastructure, with full control over security and compliance

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy

Project Phoenix supports multiple after-school care providers (Träger) and their schools (OGS) on a single deployment. Data is fully isolated at the database level via Row-Level Security.

### Tenant Hierarchy

```
Platform Operator (moto)
 └── Träger (Organization)          e.g. "AWO Köln"
      ├── OGS Sonnenschule (School)  → sonnenschule.moto-app.de
      ├── OGS Waldschule (School)    → waldschule.moto-app.de
      └── ...
```

| Concept | Model | Role |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Organization** (Träger) | `platform.organizations` | Groups schools under one administrative body |
| **School** (OGS) | `platform.schools` | The tenant boundary — all data is scoped to `tenant_id` (= school ID) |
| **Operator** | Platform scope | moto team — provisions organizations and schools |

### How It Works

- **Subdomain routing**: Each school gets a subdomain (`{slug}.moto-app.de`). Middleware extracts the slug and resolves the tenant.
- **JWT scoping**: Login returns tokens with `tenant_id`, `org_id`, and `scope` (tenant / org / platform).
- **Database isolation**: 58+ tables carry a `tenant_id` FK. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security enforces isolation at the DB level.
- **Tenant switching**: Staff with access to multiple schools can switch via `/auth/switch-tenant` without re-authenticating.
- **Operator dashboard**: Runs on a separate subdomain (`operator.moto-app.de`) with session isolation from tenant dashboards.

### Multi-tenancy in dev

By default, dev uses `TENANT_DOMAIN=localhost`. Tenant switching works, but cookies are host-scoped on `*.localhost`, so switching subdomains forces a re-login on the new subdomain. This is fine for everyday single-tenant work.

To match production cookie behavior in dev (switch tenants without re-login), opt in:

1. Set `TENANT_DOMAIN=localtest.me` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_DOMAIN=localtest.me` in your `.env`.
2. Run `sudo ./scripts/setup-e2e-hosts.sh` once to add `*.localtest.me` entries to `/etc/hosts` (needed for offline use; online, `localtest.me` resolves to `127.0.0.1` via public DNS).
3. Access tenants at `{slug}.localtest.me:3000` instead of `{slug}.localhost:3000`.

The Playwright E2E suite always uses `localtest.me` from its Go-owned E2E
contract because the tenant-switch spec needs cross-subdomain cookie sharing
independent of your dev `.env`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker and Docker Compose** — For running PostgreSQL and optional containerized development
- **Devbox** — Reproducible development environment (installs Go, Node.js, and all CLI tools)
- **direnv** — Automatic environment activation when entering the project directory

> **Why Devbox?** We use Devbox to ensure every developer has identical tool versions. No more "works on my machine" issues — everyone gets the same Go, Node.js, golangci-lint, etc.

### Install Development Tools

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install Devbox
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash

# Install direnv
brew install direnv

# Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc)
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows (WSL) / Linux</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install Devbox
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.com/devbox | bash

# Install direnv (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install direnv

# Add to ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Optional: Suppress direnv output</strong></summary>

By default, direnv prints all exported environment variables when entering the project. To silence this output, create a direnv config file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/direnv
cat > ~/.config/direnv/direnv.toml << 'EOF'
[global]
log_format = "-"
log_filter = "^$"
EOF
```

> **Note:** The `DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT` environment variable no longer works in direnv 2.36.0+ due to a [known regression](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/1418). The TOML config above is the correct solution.

</details>

### One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moto-nrw/project-phoenix.git
cd project-phoenix

# Allow direnv to activate the environment (one-time)
direnv allow

# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

When you `cd` into the project, direnv automatically activates Devbox and you'll see:
```
phoenix dev ready - go 1.25.5, node 24.x
```

All tools (Go, Node, pnpm, golangci-lint, etc.) are now available.

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8080

### Manual Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup instructions</summary>

1. **Generate SSL certificates** (required for GDPR-compliant database connections):
   ```bash
   cd config/ssl/postgres
   ./create-certs.sh
   cd ../../..
   ```

2. **Configure environment files**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/dev.env.example backend/dev.env
   # Edit the files with your settings
   ```

3. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   docker compose run server ./main migrate
   ```

</details>
