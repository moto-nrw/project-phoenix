- Node.js 20+ (for frontend development)
- PostgreSQL 17+ (if running without Docker)

### One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moto-nrw/project-phoenix.git
cd project-phoenix

# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start all services
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8080

### Manual Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup instructions</summary>

1. **Generate SSL certificates** (required for GDPR-compliant database connections):
   ```bash
   cd config/ssl/postgres
   ./create-certs.sh
   cd ../../..
   ```

2. **Configure environment files**:
   ```bash
   cp backend/dev.env.example backend/dev.env
   cp frontend/.env.local.example frontend/.env.local
   # Edit the files with your settings
   ```

3. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   docker compose run server ./main migrate
   ```

### Database Schema

The database uses PostgreSQL schemas to organize tables by domain:

| Schema | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `auth` | Authentication, tokens, permissions |
| `users` | User profiles, students, teachers, staff |
| `education` | Groups and educational structures |
| `facilities` | Rooms and physical locations |
| `activities` | Student activities and enrollments |
| `active` | Real-time session tracking |
| `schedule` | Time and schedule management |
| `iot` | RFID device management |
| `audit` | GDPR compliance logging |

## 📚 Documentation

### Development

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `go run main.go serve` | Start backend server |
| `go run main.go migrate` | Run database migrations |
| `go run main.go gendoc` | Generate API documentation |
| `npm run dev` | Start frontend dev server |

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

This project handles sensitive student data and implements comprehensive security measures:

- **SSL/TLS Encryption** — All database connections use SSL (`sslmode=require`)
- **GDPR Compliance** — Configurable data retention, audit logging, right-to-erasure
- **Role-Based Access** — Teachers only see data for students in their assigned groups
- **Secure Defaults** — No secrets in code, environment-based configuration

> **Reporting Vulnerabilities:** Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy and responsible disclosure process.
